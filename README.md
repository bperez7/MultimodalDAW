# MultimodalDAW

## Files

The index html page is located in the main prototyping directory. 

The essential libraries are found in /lib.

The main css file can be found in /css. 

The main javascript files can be found in /js, the primary being called "script" and the speech one being called "setupSpeech". 

A couple of optional backgrounds are included under the /imgs folder.

One sample track can be found in /audio (m83).


## Starting the program

In order to upload personal tracks, a local server must be started and configured. I did this by using the built-in WebStorm server by starting up WebStorm, 
using it to open up my project files, and opening up http://localhost:63342/MultimodalDaw/prototyping/index.html in my browser (directory name may change depending on setup). 
I had some trouble with Internet Explorer and Firefox, so I would recommend using Chrome.
